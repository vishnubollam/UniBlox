# Step 1: Use a base image with Python and scikit-learn
FROM python:3.8

# Step 2: Install additional dependencies (scikit-learn, SageMaker, and others if needed)
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir scikit-learn sagemaker pandas joblib boto3 flask gunicorn

# Step 3: Set the working directory where your model and code will reside
WORKDIR /Desktop/my-app

# Step 4: Copy the model and inference code into the container
# Assuming you have your model artifact in a .pkl format
COPY inference.py /Desktop/my-app/inference.py
COPY model /Desktop/my-app/model

# Your custom inference code
# Step 5: Expose the port for API requests
EXPOSE 8080

# Step 6: Define the entry point command to run the inference script (for example with Flask)
CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:8080", "inference:app"]
